 *         plexi is a CoAP interface of IEEE802.15.4 PHY, MAC (incl. TSCH) and RPL resources.
 *         Link quality metrics (ETX, RSSI, LQI), schedule properties (ASN, slotFrames and cells), DoDAG structure (parents, children) are monitored, observed or modified.
 *         (refer to "plexi: Adaptive re-scheduling web service of time synchronized low-power wireless networksÂ¨, JNCA, Elsevier)
 *
 *         plexi resource interface (header file). Landing header file.
 *         Defines new type of resources that enable both subresources and event handling.
 *         Defines commonly used functions.
 *
 *         plexi tries to follow the YANG model as defined in <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-ietf-6tisch-6top-interface-04"> 6TiSCH Operation Sublayer (6top) Interface</a>.
 *         However, as that standardization effort seems stalled, plexi has deviations from that. As soon as that activity restarts, we are keen to reconsider decisions made.
